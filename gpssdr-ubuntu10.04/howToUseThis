### HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN GPS-SDR ###

1) copy and unzip the folder gps-sdr in your desktop or 
	wherever you want.
2) In your terminal execute: 
	cd gps-sdr
	make
3) If all goes well you should have two executable files: the
	command line program gps-sdr and its gui, gps-gse

4) In your terminal execute:
	cd gps-sdr
	./gps-sdr -file bin/gps_1ms.bin

 If all goes well you should see the effect of the acquisition
 of 5 satellites, unfortunately the bit file gps_1ms.bin is only
 1ms of data. For better results you can ether get the Kai Borre,
 Akos book and convert the files that come with it with the application
 matlab/down_convert.m. Alternatively you can also use a USRP v1 or USRP
 v2 connected to your pc.


### HOW TO DEBUG GPS_SDR ###

1) open the file Makefile and change line 21 in:
	LDFLAGS	 = -lpthread -lusrp -m32 -g

2) In your terminal execute: 
	cd gps-sdr
	make clean
	make
	
3) Now, your make file can be debugged with ddd (sudo apt-get install ddd)

4) In your terminal execute:
	ddd gps-sdr
	
5) ddd will open, choose Program-run and in the Run with Arguments window
	choose -file bin/gps_1ms.bin

6) a better way to do this could be qtcreator
